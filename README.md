# Train-Schedule

## Getting Started
A deployed version of the sight can be found here https://drogalsky.github.io/Train-Schedule/

## Usage
This is mostly a database tester so usage is basically just type a name, destination, and frequency then send it. it will save to a database and be persitant.

## Challenges
I had a little trouble with permissions with this one. This is where I learned that firebase doens't always default to the database when you hit the database button which feels strange. I then had to go into rules and change the read and write rules to true which I swear i didn't have to do the first time its a bit weird.
